`Shama` is a standard OpenZeppelin ERC-20 token with a fixed supply of **210,000 SHAMA** minted at deployment. There is no mint function — the supply is permanently capped.

## Token Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | Shawarma |
| Symbol | SHAMA |
| Decimals | 18 |
| Total Supply | 210,000 (`210_000 * 10^18` base units) |

## Constructor

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `to` | `address` | Receives the entire 210,000 SHAMA supply on deployment |

## Supply Allocation

| Category | Tokens | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Pool Sales (1–10) | 95,000 | 45.2% |
| CEX Reserve | 70,000 | 33.4% |
| Expansion Vault | 45,000 | 21.4% |

Within each pool, tokens are split between sale inventory, DEX liquidity, staking rewards, and team locks.

## Integration Notes

- Standard ERC-20 — compatible with any wallet, DEX, or DeFi protocol
- No admin functions, no pause, no blocklist. Once deployed, the token operates without owner intervention
- The deployer address receives all tokens and is responsible for distributing them to sale contracts, staking contracts, liquidity pools, and reserves
- Uses 18 decimals. When interacting with USDT (6 decimals) in sale or staking contracts, be mindful of the decimal difference
