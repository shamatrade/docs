description: "Step-by-step guide to buying SHAMA, staking, and earning dual rewards from shop revenue."
---

Each of the **10 pools** bundles a token sale, a dual staking contract, and one or more real-world shops. Stakers earn rewards in both SHAMA and USDT — the USDT rewards come directly from shop revenue.

## The Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy SHAMA">
    Purchase SHAMA tokens with USDT during a pool's sale window. You can buy and hold, or buy and stake in a single transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake">
    Deposit SHAMA into the pool's dual staking contract to start earning rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Dual Rewards">
    Earn continuous SHAMA rewards over time, plus USDT rewards distributed from shop revenue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim">
    Claim your SHAMA and USDT rewards at any time, or unstake to withdraw everything.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Two Types of Rewards

### SHAMA Rewards (Time-Based)

SHAMA rewards accrue continuously over the reward period. The longer you stake, the more you earn. Rewards are split pro-rata — your share is proportional to your stake relative to the total staked in the pool.

### USDT Rewards (Revenue-Based)

USDT rewards come from real shop revenue. When the admin deposits USDT into the staking contract, it is split instantly across all current stakers based on their stake weight.

<Warning>
USDT rewards only go to users who are staked at the moment of the deposit. If you stake after a USDT distribution, you won't retroactively earn from that distribution.
</Warning>

## Buy and Stake in One Transaction

Each pool's sale contract supports an **early buy and stake** option. This lets you purchase SHAMA and immediately stake it in a single transaction — so you start earning rewards right away without needing to claim and stake separately.

## Unstaking

When you unstake, you receive your full staked principal plus all accrued SHAMA and USDT rewards. Unstaking withdraws the entire position — there is no partial unstake.

<Info>
Each pool has a minimum staking period. If you try to unstake before it elapses, the transaction will revert.
