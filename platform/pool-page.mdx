The Pool page is the main interface for interacting with a SHAMA pool. From here you can buy tokens, stake, claim rewards, and track pool activity.

## Page Layout

The page uses a two-column layout on desktop (single column on mobile):

- **Left column** — Pool sale information and content tabs (Activity, Stats, Chat, Leaderboard, Shops)
- **Right column** — Contribute panel (buy tokens) and Staking panel (stake, unstake, claim)

## Header

### Breadcrumb and Title

The header spans the full width with a gradient background. It shows:

- **Breadcrumb** — "Pools / 0x6a2c…c9D9" (the contract address is copyable)
- **Pool name** — e.g. "Pool 1 Yield Pool"
- **Copy button** — copies the staking contract address
- **Explorer link** — opens the contract on Basescan
- **YouTube button** — shown when pool status is `building`, links to shop progress videos

### Stats Bar

| Stat | Example | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Price** | $5 | USDT price per SHAMA token |
| **USDT Yields** | $4,500 | Total USDT reward allocation |
| **SHAMA Yields** | 6,000 SHAMA | SHAMA tokens allocated to the reward pool |
| **Max Total Stakes** | 20,000 SHAMA | Maximum staking capacity |

A shop counter appears to the right showing the number of shops assigned to this pool.
