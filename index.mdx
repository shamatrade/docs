## What is SHAMA?

SHAMA is a **Real World Business (RWB)** token — the first of its kind. Instead of unknown hidden assets, SHAMA is backed by real-world shawarma shops. Every SHAMA token equals 1 Shawarma and can be redeemed at any of the shops.

The SHAMA ecosystem will be built over **36 months**, pushing the token price from **5\$** per SHAMA in Pool 1 to over **\$300** per SHAMA in Pool 10.

## The 10-Pool Pricing Model

SHAMA uses a **10-pool model** where each pool funds the establishment of real-world shawarma shops. The pricing follows an exponential curve — rewarding early participants and reflecting the reduced risk as more shops become operational.

### Shops Schedule

## Token Distribution per Pool

Each pool allocates its tokens across four categories:

### Genesys (Pool 1) — 5,000 SHAMA

| Category | Tokens |
|----------|--------|
| Sale | 1,500 |
| DEX Liquidity | 1,500 |
| Staking Rewards | 1,500 |
| Team | 500 |

### Exodyne – Degen (Pools 2–10) — 10,000 SHAMA each

| Category | Tokens |
|----------|--------|
| Sale | 3,000 |
| DEX Liquidity | 3,000 |
| Staking Rewards | 3,000 |
| Team | 1,000 |

## Total Supply — 210,000 SHAMA

| Category | Tokens | % of Supply | Details |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Pool Sales (1–10) | 95,000 | 45.2% | Includes sale inventory, DEX liquidity, staking rewards, and team locks |
| CEX Reserve | 70,000 | 33.4% | Reserved for liquidity and market making on major exchanges |
| Expansion Vault | 45,000 | 21.4% | Locked for future growth (Shop 11+) and ecosystem stability |

## Strategy

### High-Incentive Staking

By matching the sale amount with staking rewards, each pool offers strong initial APR. This encourages holders to stake rather than sell while the price climbs toward $300.

### Phased Exchange Listing

SHAMA will be listed on **Binance, Bybit, Bitget, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, and OKX**. The strategy is to build volume on Tier-2 exchanges first using the 70,000 token CEX reserve, then move to Tier-1 listings.

### Scalable Funding

Capital raised per shop increases significantly in later pools. This ensures sufficient funds not just for equipment, but for regional management, marketing, and operational scaling across multiple locations.
